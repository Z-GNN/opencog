          This master issue tracks the implementation of the complete Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network across all 6 phases.

          ## Phase Overview

          - [ ] **Phase 1**: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
          - [ ] **Phase 2**: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction
