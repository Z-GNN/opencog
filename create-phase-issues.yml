          This master issue tracks the implementation of the complete Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network across all 6 phases.

          ## Phase Overview

          - [ ] **Phase 1**: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
          - [ ] **Phase 2**: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction  
          - [ ] **Phase 3**: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels
          - [ ] **Phase 4**: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer
          - [ ] **Phase 5**: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization
          - [ ] **Phase 6**: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification

          ## Architecture Vision

          Each phase is a recursive membrane, dynamically allocating attention and resources, continuously optimizing itself—synergizing into a living, distributed cognitive tapestry.

          - **Emergent unity**: Convergence toward unified cognitive tensor field
          - **Evolutionary optimization**: Continuous self-improvement cycles

          ## Success Metrics
