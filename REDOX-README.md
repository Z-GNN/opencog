```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt && cargo install hyperon
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and packages for the environment.

## Get started

To start the development environment, run the following command in the terminal:

```
python3 app.py
```

This will run the sample code provided in `app.py` and allow you to start developing and testing your own code.
