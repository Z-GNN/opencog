# Cognitive Synergy Issues GitHub Action

This GitHub Action creates issues for integrating repository functions into a cognitive synergy engine across 6 comprehensive phases of development.

## Overview

The action implements a distributed agentic cognitive grammar network through the following phases:

1. **üß¨ Phase 1**: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
2. **üß† Phase 2**: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction  
3. **‚ö° Phase 3**: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels
4. **üåê Phase 4**: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer
5. **üîÑ Phase 5**: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization
6. **üìö Phase 6**: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification

## Usage

### Create All Issues (Recommended for Initial Setup)

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Create Cognitive Synergy Issues" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Leave "Create issues for all cognitive phases" checked as `true`
5. Click "Run workflow"

This will create:
- 6 main phase issues (one for each cognitive phase)
- 12 sub-task issues (2 implementation issues per phase)
- 1 master tracking issue that links everything together

### Create Issues for Specific Phase

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Create Cognitive Synergy Issues" workflow  
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Uncheck "Create issues for all cognitive phases"
5. Enter the phase number (1-6) in "Create issues for specific phase"
6. Click "Run workflow"

## Issue Structure

Each phase follows a consistent structure:

### Main Phase Issues
- **Objective**: Clear description of the phase goal
- **Sub-Steps**: Detailed breakdown of implementation tasks
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs expected from the phase
- **Labels**: Categorized for easy filtering and organization

### Implementation Sub-Issues
- **Task Description**: Specific implementation focus
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success metrics
- **Technical Requirements**: Detailed technical specifications
- **Parent Issue Reference**: Links back to main phase issue

### Master Tracking Issue
- **Complete Progress Tracking**: Checkboxes for all phases and sub-tasks
- **Recursive Implementation Pathway**: Visual flowchart of the cognitive process
- **Design Principles**: Core architectural guidelines
- **Next Actions**: Clear guidance for getting started

## Key Principles

- **Real Data Only**: No mocks or simulations - all tests use live data
- **Recursive Modularity**: Each phase builds upon the previous in a fractal pattern
- **Evolutionary Adaptability**: Continuous self-improvement and optimization
- **Cognitive Unity**: All modules converge toward emergent cognitive synthesis
- **Maximal Clarity**: Transparent documentation and verification at every step

## Labels Used

The action creates issues with the following label categories:

- `cognitive-synergy`: All issues related to this initiative
- `phase-X`: Phase-specific labels (phase-1 through phase-6)
- `implementation`: Sub-task implementation issues
- Technology-specific: `hypergraph`, `atomspace`, `ecan`, `ggml`, `api`, etc.
- Process-specific: `testing`, `documentation`, `benchmarking`, `optimization`

## Getting Started

1. **Run the workflow** to create all issues
2. **Review the master tracking issue** for overall coordination
3. **Start with Phase 1** issues for foundational implementation
4. **Follow the recursive implementation pathway** outlined in the master issue
5. **Maintain real-data verification** throughout all phases

## Integration with Inferno OS

This cognitive synergy framework is designed to integrate with the Inferno distributed operating system, leveraging its:

- Distributed computing capabilities
- File-based resource abstraction
- Network transparency
- Concurrent programming model (Limbo)

The cognitive grammar network will extend Inferno's distributed paradigm into AI and cognitive computing domains.
