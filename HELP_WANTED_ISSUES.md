## Implementation Guidelines

- All implementations should use real data, not mocks or simulations
- Prioritize minimal, surgical changes to existing codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems
- Document all tensor shape signatures and cognitive primitives
- Implement comprehensive testing for validation

## Integration Points

- **AtomSpace**: Core hypergraph data structure
- **GGML**: Tensor operations and neural processing
- **Scheme**: High-level cognitive programming
- **ECAN**: Attention and resource allocation
- **PLN/MOSES/RelEx**: Reasoning and learning systems
