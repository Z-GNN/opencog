    title: "Create Rigorous Test Harness for PLN, MOSES, and RelEx",
    body: `
## ðŸ§ª Rigorous Test Harness for Core Reasoning Systems

### Objective
Develop comprehensive test harnesses for PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks), MOSES, and RelEx to ensure real implementations (not mocks) and validate functionality.

### Background
Many OpenCog reasoning systems lack rigorous testing. Given that PLN is marked as "no longer maintained" and other systems may have unknown states, we need definitive validation.

### Technical Requirements

#### PLN Testing
- [ ] Validate existing PLN implementations vs. theoretical specifications
- [ ] Create test cases for probabilistic inference chains
- [ ] Benchmark reasoning accuracy against known datasets
- [ ] Test integration with URE (Unified Rule Engine)

#### MOSES Testing  
- [ ] Verify as-moses AtomSpace integration works correctly
- [ ] Create genetic programming validation tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for learning tasks
- [ ] Integration tests with existing knowledge bases

#### RelEx Testing
- [ ] Natural language parsing accuracy tests
- [ ] Integration with Link Grammar validation
- [ ] Semantic representation correctness
- [ ] Performance tests on large text corpora

#### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Automated CI/CD integration for all tests
- [ ] Real data validation (no mocks or simulations)
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Coverage reporting for all components

### Test Data Requirements
- Use real linguistic data for RelEx
- Employ actual probabilistic reasoning problems for PLN
- Utilize genuine machine learning benchmarks for MOSES
- All tests must validate against ground truth, not artificial cases

### Acceptance Criteria
- 90%+ test coverage for active codepaths
- All tests use real data and real implementations
- Automated test execution in CI pipeline
- Performance baselines established for all systems
- Clear documentation of what works vs. what doesn't

    title: "Implement ECAN as Dynamic GGML Tensor Membrane",
    body: `
## ðŸ§  ECAN Resource Allocation as GGML Tensor Membrane

### Objective
Transform ECAN (Economic Attention Allocation) into a dynamic tensor membrane using GGML, enabling efficient resource allocation and adaptive cognitive processing.

### Background
ECAN manages cognitive resources by allocating attention values to atoms. By representing this as a tensor membrane, we can leverage GPU acceleration and create more sophisticated attention mechanisms.

### Technical Requirements

#### Adaptive Mechanisms
- [ ] Self-modification pathways for attention allocation strategies
- [ ] Meta-cognitive feedback loops for resource optimization
- [ ] Learning algorithms for improving allocation efficiency
- [ ] Integration with existing ECAN bank structures

#### Tensor Architecture
Define tensor dimensions by subsystem complexity:
- Attention values tensor: [atoms, time_steps, context_layers]
- Resource flow tensor: [source_atoms, target_atoms, flow_strength]
- Priority tensor: [atoms, urgency_levels, importance_weights]

### Performance Goals
- Real-time attention updates for 100K+ atoms
- GPU acceleration achieving 10x speedup over CPU
- Memory usage within 2GB for typical workloads

## ðŸ“š Cognitive Kernel Catalog Implementation

### Objective
Develop a dynamic dictionary system that catalogs all implemented cognitive primitives with their tensor shape signatures and adaptation patterns.

- [ ] Interaction patterns with other primitives

#### Introspective Diagnostics
- [ ] "Cognitive mirrors" for real-time system state analysis
- [ ] Performance monitoring for subsystem health
- [ ] Resource flow visualization
- [ ] Emergent behavior detection and cataloging

    "memory_complexity": "O(...)",
    "benchmark_results": {...}
  },
  "dependencies": ["primitive_ids..."],
  "status": "active|deprecated|experimental"
}
\`\`\`

### Implementation Approach
